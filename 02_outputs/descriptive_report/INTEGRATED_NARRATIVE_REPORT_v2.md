## Part 1: The Food Landscape That Vendors Create

Long Biên District's food environment comprises **284 surveyed vendors** 
operating across diverse retail formats. These vendors create the external food 
environment—the structural availability, variety, and accessibility that households

## Part 2: How Households Navigate This Landscape

The **214 surveyed households** navigate Long Biên's food environment 
with differentiated resources, constraints, and strategies. Personal domain 
factors—accessibility, affordability, and perceptions—mediate how the external 
vendor landscape translates into household food acquisition.


### 2.1 Household Characteristics

Households average **4.5 members**, with composition reflecting 
typical urban Vietnamese family structures.


### 2.2 Accessibility Patterns

Households travel an average of **8.0 minutes** (median: 5 min) 
to reach food vendors. This temporal accessibility dimension shapes which vendor 
formats households can practically access given work and care responsibilities.


### 2.3 Neighborhood Context

Household perceptions of neighborhood quality (scale: -2 to +2):

- **Cleanliness**: 1.44

- **Safety**: 1.66

- **Reputation**: 1.59


These neighborhood perceptions shape food acquisition strategies beyond 
proximity, influencing where households feel comfortable shopping.


### 2.4 Affordability Constraints

Median household food expenditure: **110,000 VND** 
(IQR: 200–3,000,000 VND). 
The wide expenditure range reflects differentiated affordability constraints 
that shape which vendor formats and food types households can access.

## Part 3: Dietary Outcomes

The interaction of vendor-supplied availability and household-mediated access 
produces observable dietary patterns measured through dietary diversity.


### 3.1 Household Dietary Diversity

Mean HDDS: **0.89** (SD: 2.48, Median: 0). 


Most commonly consumed food groups:

- **Spices Cond Bev**: 11.2% of households

- **Sweets**: 9.8% of households

- **Cereals**: 9.3% of households

- **Oils Fats**: 6.5% of households

- **Fruits Other**: 6.1% of households

## Part 4: Integrated Insights


### 4.1 Supply-Demand Alignment

Comparing vendor supply with household consumption reveals:

- **Vendor top offerings**: spices cond bev, cereals, sweets

- **Household top consumption**: spices cond bev, sweets, cereals


Alignment observed in: **sweets, spices cond bev, cereals**


### 4.2 Structural Patterns

Three structural patterns emerge from the integrated data:


1. **Retail Diversity Coexists with Spatial Inequality**: 
284 vendors across 55 neighborhoods create uneven 
accessibility, with household travel times varying substantially.


2. **Traditional-Modern Transition Underway**: 
Vendor composition (44% processed vs 37% whole foods) 
reflects Vietnam's nutrition transition, with implications for dietary outcomes.


3. **Affordability Mediates Access**: 
Wide food expenditure variation (IQR: 200–3,000,000 VND) suggests 
affordability constraints differentiate which households can access higher-quality vendors.

## Narrative Conclusions


This integrated view reveals Long Biên's food environment as a complex 
system where vendor-created structural features interact with household-level 
mediating factors to produce dietary outcomes. The narrative journey from 
**vendors** (who create availability) → **households** (who navigate constraints) 
→ **diets** (measurable outcomes) demonstrates how food environments function 
not as static backdrops but as dynamic systems shaped by both supply-side 
structures and demand-side realities.


Key insights for food environment interventions:

- Vendor diversity alone does not guarantee household dietary diversity

- Accessibility (travel time) and affordability (expenditure capacity) mediate access

- Neighborhood perceptions influence where households feel comfortable shopping

- The nutrition transition (processed vs whole foods) is observable in both supply and demand
