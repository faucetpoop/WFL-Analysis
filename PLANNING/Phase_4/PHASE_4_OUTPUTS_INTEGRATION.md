# Phase 4: Outputs & Thesis Integration

**Objective**: Organize analysis outputs and prepare for thesis chapter integration
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Input**: All Phase 1-3 results and tables
**Output**: Organized results, figure-ready tables, thesis-integration summary

---

## Task 1: Organize Output Tables

Create final publication-ready tables:

```r
# Table 1: Descriptive Statistics (All OPs)
# Table 2A: HDDS by Accessibility
# Table 2B: HDDS by Affordability (3 groups)
# Table 2C: HDDS by Food Safety
# Table 3: Correlation Matrix
# Table 4: Regression Models (5 models)
# Table 5: Standardized Coefficients Ranking
```

**Save location**: `02_outputs/tables/`

---

## Task 2: Create Figures

Generate publication-ready visualizations:

```r
# Figure 1: HDDS Distribution (histogram)
# Figure 2: HDDS by Accessibility (box plot)
# Figure 3: HDDS by Affordability (box plot, 3 groups)
# Figure 4: HDDS by Food Safety (box plot)
# Figure 5: Standardized Coefficients Plot
```

**Save location**: `02_outputs/figures/`

---

## Task 3: Create Summary Datasets

Save processed/derived data:

```
02_outputs/datasets/
├── household_analysis_final.csv          (all OPs + outcomes)
├── t2_comparison_results.csv             (summary by strata)
└── correlation_summary.csv               (key correlations)
```

---

## Task 4: Thesis Integration Mapping

Create reference document mapping outputs to chapters:

**Chapter 4 Results Mapping**:
- Table 1 → Descriptive Results section
- Tables 2A-C → T2 Analysis Results
- Table 4C → Full Model Results

**Chapter 5 Discussion**:
- Effects interpretation
- Comparison to literature
- Limitations (OP008 not measured, etc.)

---

## Task 5: Limitations Documentation

Document all study limitations:

- [ ] OP008: Marketing & Regulation NOT measured
- [ ] OP024/OP027: Status verification needed
- [ ] OP028: Single timepoint (no temporal stability)
- [ ] OP003: Motive-based price proxy, not actual audit
- [ ] OP014: Asset-based income proxy, not direct measurement
- [ ] Any data quality issues
- [ ] Sample characteristics & generalizability

---

## Phase 4 Outputs

- [ ] All tables formatted and saved
- [ ] All figures created and saved
- [ ] Thesis integration guide created
- [ ] Limitations document completed
- [ ] Data dictionary created

---

## Phase 4 Completion Criteria

✅ **All analysis results organized**
✅ **Tables formatted for thesis**
✅ **Figures publication-ready**
✅ **Limitations clearly documented**
✅ **Thesis integration mapping complete**
